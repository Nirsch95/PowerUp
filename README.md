### Configuration Layer

It is the outermost layer and is responsible for security configuration using Spring Security and JWT, class assignment, dependency injection, exception usage and bean configurations.

### Adapters Layer

This layer contains two layers: the driven layer and the driven layer, which are responsible for all reception and adaptation by the client or server.

#### Drivin Layer

It is the user's entry point when connecting to the application, it allows the user to interact with the api.

### Domain Layer

It is the most internal module of the architecture, it belongs to the domain layer and encapsulates the business logic and rules.
